# Telegram-Bot-PHP-Upload
This code uses the Telegram Bot API library to receive the file sent to the bot, download it, and then upload it to the server. The direct link is then generated by concatenating the server's URL with the file's path on the server. And then sends it back to the user via Telegram.

Please note that:

YOUR_BOT_TOKEN should be replaced with the token you received from the BotFather.
path/to/bot-api-sdk-php/autoload.php should be the path to the Telegram Bot API library's autoload file.
path/to/save/file/on/server.ext should be the path to the directory on your server where you want to save the file, including the file name and extension.
'https://your-domain.com/' should be the URL of your server where the file is saved.
$update is the array that contains the update data from the telegram. It is usually passed as parameter in the function that handle the update.
It's important to mention that this code snippet is just a sample and might not work as is, you need to implement it with your existing codebase, and handle the edge cases and security measures. You should also make sure that the PHP file is able to write to the specified directory on the server.
